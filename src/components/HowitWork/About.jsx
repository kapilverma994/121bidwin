              TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            </h3>
            <p>
              When a coin price on a particular product reaches to the INR 20
              then no new manual bidders or new bid boss by the first time coin
              placing user will be accepted. Those users who are placing coins
              from the time before it reaches at 20 Rs. can only continue
              placing coins. No new user can be able to place any manual coins
              or book any bid boss in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              However number of coins in existing bid boss can be upgrade or
              decrease by the user. This policy will secure the interest for the
              users who have spent their maximum efforts for winning the
              product.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Example: If the product's actual price is 1000 rs. and it
              reaches to Rs. 20 . Now no new bidder can place manual coins or
              can book any new bid boss. Only those extsting bid boss or users
              playing can place coins manually. However number of coins can be
              changed in the existing bid boss and old existing users can book
              any new bid boss.
            </p>
            <p>No fraudulent entries will be entertained.</p>
            <p>
              For any confliction 121bidwin team decision is final and agreed by
              all.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the 5 seconds has been passed and no one make the bid then the
              1st bidder will take the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              If user wins on any product he has to pay us the bid price through
              paytm. For example,the product worth is 1000 rs. and the bid price
              is rs. 200 then you have to pay us rs. 200 via razorpay and your
              product will be order the same day.
            </p>
            <p>
